# Making a Bitcoin Nova Wallet

There are multiple different types of wallets you can choose to use for Bitcoin Nova, paper wallets, CLI wallets, GUI wallets and Web Wallets.

We recommend making a paper wallet so that you can start receiving funds, and later import them into a GUI or CLI wallet.

## Paper Wallet

The main purpose of a paper wallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds.

**You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI, GUI or Web Wallet.**

## bitcoinnova-wallet (CLI Wallet)

The CLI Wallet, called bitcoinnova-wallet, is a multi-platform program (Win/Linux/Mac) that requires you to enter commands for it to work and you cannot use your mouse. However, it is currently the most stable and gets the newest updates first.
